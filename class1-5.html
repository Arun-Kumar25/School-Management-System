                        <h3>OVERVIEW:</h3>
                        <p>JEE Main is the single entrance for admission to undergraduate engineering programs at NITs, IITs, Centrally Funded Technical Institutions (CFTIs) as well as other engineering colleges and technology institutes run by the state governments and private institutions who have adopted JEE. Every year the Joint Entrance Examination Mains is held by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The criteria for the selection in the examination would include the performance in the class 12/equivalent qualifying examination and in the JEE (Main) exams.</p>
                        <p>The most crucial point about the JEE Main exam is that only top 1.5 lakh candidates of JEE Main are eligible for JEE Advanced Examination. Hence, it is very important for the JEE Main aspirants to be thoroughly prepared for the upcoming test.</p>
                        <p>Students who crack JEE Advanced successfully will be able to join the undergraduate programs in Engineering, Architecture and Sciences at all IITs and ISM Dhanbad according to their All India Rank (AIR) in the exam.</p>
